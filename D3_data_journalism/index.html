          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>OBESITY</strong><br>
            Obesity is a major public health issue. According to a recent trend analysis in 200 countries,
            age-standardised prevalence of obesity increased from 3.2% to 10.8% between 1975 and 2014 in men, and from 6.4% to 14.9% in women.
            1 In this study, like in many others, obesity was defined by a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. 
            Obesity is a major risk factor for all-cause mortality, a number of non-communicable diseases and reduced quality of life.<br></p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
            Within social epidemiological research, income (as an indicator of the socioeconomic status; SES) was found to be inversely 
            associated with obesity, though this relationship can be interpreted in two directions: (1) the causation hypothesis that explains 
            lower income as a cause for subsequent obesity and (2) the perspective of a reversed causality, in which obesity is not the result, 
            but rather the cause for lower income.<br></p> 

            <p style="text-align: left;">
            In order to describe why people with lower income are more vulnerable to obesity, the framework of social determinants of health 
            indicates that material conditions confine one’s access to (healthy) food and healthcare, while also influencing health-related
            behaviours (ie, dietary behaviours and physical activity),and psychosocial factors that derive from relative deprivation 
            (eg, control over life, insecurity, social isolation, stress).<br></p> 

          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SMOKING</strong><br>
            Higher rates of smoking and longer average times until cessation mean that lower socio-economic status (SES) smokers are more likely to suffer both frequent financial stress and longer periods of compromised living standards than their counterparts in the higher strata.<br> 
            Research in the UK found that nearly half of all children in relative poverty in 2012 had at least one smoking parent, and about 432,000 additional children would be classed as being in poverty if parental tobacco expenditure were subtracted from household income.<br>
            In low- and middle-income countries, daily tobacco use is associated with lower household expenditures on education and healthcare.</p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>HEALTHCARE</strong><br>
            Poverty is a complex and insidious determinant of health caused by systemic factors that can persist for generations in a family.
            Beginning before birth and continuing throughout an individual’s life, poverty can significantly impact health and health outcomes.
            The vision of the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) is to transform health care to achieve optimal health for everyone. 
            Primary care physicians and public health professionals continue to collaborate on a shared vision of improving population health. </p>
